> Q# is Microsoft’s open-source programming language for developing and running quantum algorithms. It’s part of the Quantum Development Kit (QDK), which includes Q# libraries, quantum simulators, extensions for other programming environments, and API documentation. In addition to the Standard Q# library, the QDK includes Chemistry, Machine Learning, and Numeric libraries.
>
> As a programming language, Q# draws familiar elements from Python, C#, and F# and supports a basic procedural model for writing programs with loops, if/then statements, and common data types. It also introduces new quantum-specific data structures and operations.
