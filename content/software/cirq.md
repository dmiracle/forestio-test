> Cirq is a Python software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits, and then running them on quantum computers and quantum simulators. Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with todayâ€™s noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, where details of the hardware are vital to achieving state-of-the-art results.n
