> ProjectQ is an open-source software framework for quantum computing started at ETH Zurich. It allows users to implement their quantum programs in Python using a powerful and intuitive syntax. ProjectQ can then translate these programs to any type of back-end, be it a simulator run on a classical computer or an actual quantum chip.
