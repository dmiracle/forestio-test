> Quantum Circuits, Inc. (QCI) is developing a full-stack quantum computing platform based on superconducting devices and a modular, robust and scalable architecture. QCI was founded by three world-leading experts in quantum devices and information processing from the Department of Applied Physics at Yale University: Michel Devoret, Luigi Frunzio, and Robert Schoelkopf. Their group has produced many scientific firsts, including the development of a "quantum bus" for entangling qubits with wires and the first implementation of a quantum algorithms and error-correction with a solid-state device.
